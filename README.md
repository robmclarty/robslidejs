# robslidejs
##### A not-so-advanced jQuery slideshow

Slides cross-fade from one to the next and can have either colored or imaged backgrounds.

Override the base CSS with your own styles to suit your design and input data for the
slideshow with a JSON-formatted array.

Three examples are included. The first, default, example simply shows what happens when
no styles or data are applied. There is an example with image backgrounds, and another
with simple colored backgrounds.

An optional link button can be included for each slide, or left blank. If not defined,
no button will be rendered.
